ArrangeIt - arrange people or things, intelligently

For now just a command line tool, `arrangeit` is an engine for things like:
- Grouping people into teams by certain attributes like age or gender
- Organizing rides for people spread all over the place

More documentation to come; for now look at the code, or run it:

```
go install github.com/dankinder/arrangeit
arrangeit -h
```
